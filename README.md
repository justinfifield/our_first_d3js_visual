Boilerplate code for an Interactive Visualization January course at Harvard's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences

This is a test boilerplate visualization prepared for Day 2 of the Interactive Visualization course during the January term at Harvard University's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Here is a sample boilerplate page:

[http://nesterko.com/visuals/our-first-d3js-visualization/](http://nesterko.com/visuals/our-first-d3js-visualization/)

The exercise aims to demonstrate basic functionality of the library, as well as teach basic display brushing using d3js, using two template displays below as boilerplate. To start working on it, pull from the Github repo:

https://github.com/nesterko/our_first_d3js_visual

Then run 'bash server.sh' (requires Python 2.7.x installed on your computer) in the Terminal, go to 

[http://localhost:8888/our-first-d3js-visualization/](http://localhost:8888/our-first-d3js-visualization/)

After that, erase the header from index.html, and go exlore and edit jdriver.js (there are more instructions in the file).

Enjoy!

ps. There are several things used here, such as Jade, which are not described in-depth (yet).
You don't need to know them to go through the exercise and experiment.
